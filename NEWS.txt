Vaca 0.0.5

  - removed SimpleWorld example (HelloWorld is good enough).
  - removed Curves example (Maths replaced it).

    "deleteAfterEvent" methods of Widget class.

- replaced postQuitMessage() (the WM_QUIT message isn't used anymore),
  with breakMessageLoop() (using an internal flag).
- better solution for onClose() event: now when a Frame is closed,
  it's just hidden (like Dialogs). The message loop ends when all
  frames are hidden (not disposed, just hidden).

  GetClientRect).
